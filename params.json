{"name":"Facer","tagline":"A face detection based on OpenCV","body":"### Face Recognition Project\r\nThe purpose is to come up with a better Face Recognition algorithm\r\n\r\n\r\n### Already accomplished.\r\n1. How to detect face from the photo by using the cascaded face detector.\r\n2. How to improve the face detection rate(Rotate the photo, used adaptive equalizer)\r\n3. Use fisher face algorithm to extract the feature from the image. \r\n\r\n### Next Mile stone\r\n1. Come up with following command tools:\r\n a. Face extractor can extract the face from the photo.\r\n  Following is the command line command.\r\n    \r\n    extractor -i input.jpg -o /output_folder/result.jpg\r\n   Returned text will have\r\n   Why not use the definition of the face plus directly, seems like the right thing to do. \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  [{\r\n    rotate:0,//degree\r\n     x:0.4,\r\n     y:0.1,\r\n     width:0.02,\r\n     height:0.04\r\n}, {\r\n     rotate:20,//degree\r\n     x:0.4,\r\n     y:0.1,\r\n     width:0.02,\r\n     height:0.04\r\n}]\r\n```\r\nWill tell at which rotate angle this face get detected. \r\n\r\n    train -i source.csv -o train.dat\r\n\r\nwill train the current data,  the output file will keep the trained data. \r\n\r\n    search -i trained.dat -s head.jpg\r\n\r\nWill search the result against the head.jpg files. \r\nWhat's assumption we make for the head.jpg?\r\nIt is already a extracted head file and normalized. \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
